This repository archives the code for Leetcode Challenges that I have written. This collection serves to document my progress and as a reference for future challenges.

# Overview of Solved Challenges
This overview shows which Leetcode Challenges I have solved and what their requirements were.

L 1. Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. **Solved with (O(n^2)) and (O(n))**

L 13. Roman to Integer: Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. **Solved**

L 14. Longest Common Prefix: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. **Solved**

L 20. Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. **Solved**

L 21. Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. **Solved with recursive**

L 35. Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. **Solved with (O(n))**
